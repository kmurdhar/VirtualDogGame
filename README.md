# VirtualDogGame
A fun, interactive desktop virtual pet game built with **Java Swing**. It features an animated dog that walks across the screen, responds to keyboard and mouse input, fetches bones, bounces balls, and even barks! Ideal as a beginner-to-intermediate GUI and event-driven programming project in Java.
